                        <p>Welcome to the maiTea Bot information page! To add the bot to your server, click <a href="https://canary.discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1145864748093669416">this link</a>! Last updated: 28th August 2024, 02:50 BST<br><br>The maiTea Bot allows you to view your maimai FiNALE (and older) profile, scores, and other data on Discord, alongside various other tools. You can see your own data, or another persons, by submitting their username.<br><br>When you sign up to the bot, anyone else with access to the bot can lookup your data assuming they have your Discord profile.<br><br>Please note that, while this bot is in the official maiTea Discord server, it is not ran, moderated, or developed by maiTea themselves. It is a fan-made project.</p>

                    <div class="contents tx_c">
                        <p>maiTea API tokens offer very limited functionality, specifically read-only functions for reading scores, profiles, plays, and some other information. Profiles can <em>not be written to, edited, or deleted</em> using these tokens. For further information on the API, please read the <a href="https://maitea.app/docs">maiTea API documentation</a>.<br><br>Due to the nature of the information stored, and it not being sensitive, it is stored in plain-text JSON alongside the project's code. The only information stored is the following:<br>API access token, Discord user ID, maimai profile name, the latest time the profile got updated, the rating, and peak rating of the profile.<br><br>It is not shared with anyone else, and cannot be accessed by anyone else. Access codes and other information not included above is <em>not stored</em>. If you are unhappy with this, and would like your information removed, please contact me in the maiTea Discord.</p>

                    <h3>Bot Permissions</h3>
                    <div class="contents tx_c">
                        <p>When adding the bot to your user account, the only permissions accessed are app commands access. The bot is unable to read information about your profile other than basic information, and it is not possible to identify who exactly has added it.<br><br>The default invite link contains the permission code <code>139586817088</code>, which only allows read/send messages, and external emoji uses, alongside some others. There are no moderation/administrator permissions used. This permission code is not required for the bot to be used, unless owner-specific non-slash commands are required in the server.</p>
